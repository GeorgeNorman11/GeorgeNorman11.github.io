								        <h3> 3D modling in blender </h3>
								<p>
									The following section will discuss how I created the final 3D model of the prosthetic hand outlining all steps and mishaps along the way. Overall, 
									I found working with blender to be quite fun and simple I think I picked it up quickly, this could be due to my past experience with blender.
									<br>
									First, I put my hand model that I got scanned into blender and set it to scale. This was very simple I just had to drag and drop the STL file into blender however 
									it did take a bit of trial and error to get the scale perfect. Scale is not super important though as the scale can always be changed later. 
								</p>

								<p>
									Now that the hand is in blender, I had to add a plane and put it over the finger so I can make the cut. I gave the plane a smaller thickness to make it more suitable for 3D printing. 
									I did this with a solidify modifier. I then used a Boolean modifier on the hand select difference and select the plane. Once applied, I hid the plane and 
									I saw a small cut meaning the cut has been made. However, 
									it is still only one object so, I had to separate them start by selecting the finger in edit mode. Press p and selection then go back into object mode. Now the is finger off.
									<br>
									 These steps were incredibly simple just add a plane move it into position add the modifiers and the cut is made. 
									Without the use of the modifiers I fear this prosess would have been far more complicated and time consuming however, the modifiers it only takes a cuple minutes.

									Now time to add the joint. First, I had to add a cube into the finger and scale it to an appropriate size. I then selected the finger,
									and I added a union Boolean and selected the cube. Now time for the other side of the joint. I started by putting the same cube
									into the hand. Once done I made two copies and put them either side of the original
									leaving a little space in between and make the two copies a little narrower. I then added the unionize Boolean modifier to the two copies with the hand and deleted the 
									original cube and its copies. Then I needed to add a connection joint. I put a cylinder in the middle of the 3 connecting cubes added to the finger and hand. Then I used another 
									Boolean modifier on both parts and select difference and the cylinder. 
									Now there is a hole in the joint that goes all the way through. 
									Then I moved the cylinder off to the side and scale it down a bit once printed it will slide back into the holes made and complete the joint and be held in by the aesthetic covering. 
								</p>

								<br>

								<p>
									This proses was far fiddlier than just making a simple cut. The most difficult part of this was insuring everything was lined up correctly. 
									Quit a lot had to be considered for example the size of the
									joining cubes if made too big they may get in the way of the hinge functioning. Also the joint has to be strong enough that it can withstand everyday use.
