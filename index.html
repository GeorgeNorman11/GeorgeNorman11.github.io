									<h2>Introduction</h2>
								</header>
								<p>
									In this document we will be discussing how we will be building the artifact. 
									The artifact we have decided on to go with is a 3D printed prosthetic hand. 
									We will show this through flow diagram, hand scans, drawings, and rendered models.

								<h3>
									1, 3D scanning hardware, software, and workshop facilities
								</h3>
								<br>


								<p>
									In this project does use 3D scanning hardware. The prosses was very interesting, in this project what was scanned was George’s hand. The prosses of scanning a human hand is quite difficult
									as unlike objects commonly scanned with the 3D scanner the human hand is connected to the arm via the wrist this means that a complete 3D scan is impossible, unless the hand was severed from 
									the wrist. The solution to this problem is to create the best scan possible and fill in the whole at the base of the hand. 

									In the 3D scanning workshop, each person had the opportunity to get an object of their choice 3D scanned. George brought in a Chewbacca Funko pop pin figure; this object also had some 
									challenges as the back of the figure was somewhat reflective which slightly interfered with the lasers used in the 3D scanning proses. 
  
									A real-world use case for 3D scanners is in the manufacturing world for example a manufacture of wooden sculptures could use 3D scanners to create a digital version of there product that 
									could be integrated into Augmented Reality (AR) and viewed in the customers property before the sale.

								<h3>
									2, Motion capture hardware, software, and stage facilities
								</h3>
								<br>

								<p>
									This project features zero motion capture as it was deemed unnecessary for this project. 

									However, a motion capture workshop was attended where a demonstration of the motion capture hardware and software took place, this workshop was very interesting.

									A real-world use case of motion capture is animation production.

								</p>
								<br>
								<p>
									Motion capture technology emerges as a critical element that transforms the paradigm of 3D animation production (Wibowo, M.C., Nugroho, S. and Wibowo, A., 2024)

								</p>
								<br>
								<h3>
									3, Computer Aided Design (CAD) software package
								</h3>
								<br>
								<p>
									CAD was used very minimally in this project. As the hand model was created using 3D scanning there was not much need to use CAD however, 
									CAD software such as Fusion 360 was still used to inspect the model of the hand to insure it was suitable for 3D modelling. 

									A real-world use case of CAD is prototype production.
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>

									Computer-aided design (CAD) and additive manufacturing (AM) have rapidly grown in prototype production, particularly in the metal-mechanical industry. 
									(Vido, M., de Oliveira Neto, G.C., Lourenço, S.R., Amorim, M. and Rodrigues, M.J.F., 2024)

								</p>
								<br>
								<h3>
									4. 3D modelling software
								</h3>
								<br>


								<p>
									This project used 3D modelling software significantly. The 3D modelling software used in this project was blender. The prosses of learning about blender and using blender was very
									enjoyable and interesting and came quite naturally due to prior experiences. Blender was used to modify the hand model, so it had some articulation and was ready for 3D printing. 

									3D modelling software has so many real-world use cases from games development to product design to restoration of fossils. 
								</p>
								<br>
								<p>

									Each bone was CTscanned, segmented, and imported into Blender, an open-source 3D-graphics animation program. Blender has an animation tool called an “armature” that allows for precise control
									over portions of a surface mesh while keeping a record of manipulations. To retrodeform a fossil, an armature is created and then linked, or “rigged,” to the fossil in order to control the 
									displacement and distortion of its fragments. After using the armature to perform retrodeformation, we use Blender to record the movement and distortion of each fragment
									and also record reconstructive modifications. (DeVries, R.P., Sereno, P.C., Vidal, D. and Baumgart, S.L., 2022)

								</p>
								
								<br>

								        <h4> 3D modling in blender </h4>
								<p>
									The following section will discuss how I created the final 3D model of the prosthetic hand outlining all steps and mishaps along the way. Overall, 
									I found working with blender to be quite fun and simple I think I picked it up quickly, this could be due to my past experience with blender.
									<br>
									First, I put my hand model that I got scanned into blender and set it to scale. This was very simple I just had to drag and drop the STL file into blender however 
									it did take a bit of trial and error to get the scale perfect. Scale is not super important though as the scale can always be changed later. 
								</p>
								        <img src="hand in blender.png" alt="Georges hand2">
								<p>
									Now that the hand is in blender, I had to add a plane and put it over the finger so I can make the cut. I gave the plane a smaller thickness to make it more suitable for 3D printing. 
									I did this with a solidify modifier. I then used a Boolean modifier on the hand select difference and select the plane. Once applied, I hid the plane and 
									I saw a small cut meaning the cut has been made. However, 
									it is still only one object so, I had to separate them start by selecting the finger in edit mode. Press p and selection then go back into object mode. Now the is finger off.
									<br>
									 These steps were incredibly simple just add a plane move it into position add the modifiers and the cut is made. 
									Without the use of the modifiers I fear this prosess would have been far more complicated and time consuming however, the modifiers it only takes a cuple minutes.

									Now time to add the joint. First, I had to add a cube into the finger and scale it to an appropriate size. I then selected the finger,
									and I added a union Boolean and selected the cube. Now time for the other side of the joint. I started by putting the same cube
									into the hand. Once done I made two copies and put them either side of the original
									leaving a little space in between and make the two copies a little narrower. I then added the unionize Boolean modifier to the two copies with the hand and deleted the 
									original cube and its copies. Then I needed to add a connection joint. I put a cylinder in the middle of the 3 connecting cubes added to the finger and hand. Then I used another 
									Boolean modifier on both parts and select difference and the cylinder. 
									Now there is a hole in the joint that goes all the way through. 
									Then I moved the cylinder off to the side and scale it down a bit once printed it will slide back into the holes made and complete the joint and be held in by the aesthetic covering. 
								</p>

								<br>

								<p>
									This proses was far fiddlier than just making a simple cut. The most difficult part of this was insuring everything was lined up correctly. 
									Quit a lot had to be considered for example the size of the
									joining cubes if made too big they may get in the way of the hinge functioning. Also the joint has to be strong enough that it can withstand everyday use.

									I followed the same process to cut and join the thumb as I did the finger however, the thumb was quite more difficult as the thumb is on an angle, so all of the connections 
									had to be on an angle. Arranging all of the joining cubes for the thumb took considerably more time than the finger due to the angle however it was achieved. 

									Again the Boolean modifiers was extremely useful and they are what I used for the cuts and mergers.

									The tip of the index finger was cut off. On the finger a cube was attached using the Boolean join modifier and on the severed tip 
									the same cube was used to make an indentation that the cube on the finger could fit in to so the cube indentation had to be a 
									little bit bigger so the joint would work smoothly.

									5. Haptic input hardware and associated 3D sculpting software
								</h3>
								<br>
								<p>
									This project did not use any type of haptic input hardware such as the haptic pen. Although the haptic pen could have been utilised in this project it was deemed unnecessary as 
									3D modelling software was used instead.

									The haptic pen was used in an introductory workshop, using the haptic pen was quite interesting and its usefulness was certainly apparent in the context of 3D sculpting. 
									The haptic feedback of the haptic pen was a key feature bridging the hardware and software worlds allowing the user full immersion.
 
									Haptic input hardware such as the haptic pen only has one main use which is 3D sculpting this could be very useful for creating models of items that do not yet exist.
